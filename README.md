# Example API automated test framework

## Introduction
This repository holds examples of the API automation frameworks that have been implemented previously. 
These implementations are across various organisations and roles and have been cleaned of any identifiable information.

## Technologies

| Technology | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Rest-Assured | Create and send API requests |
| HoverFly | API endpoint mocks to allow tests to be created before the API is ready.  Here they are used in place of the original API|
| GSON | Convert objects to JSON |

## Requirements
A requirements document has been added which all frameworks will need to test against.  This document can be found in 
the root project directory.

## Projects
### Simple Example
This shows an example of a quick and dirty implementation for API testing using Rest-Assured, Hoverfly, and Junit5.
